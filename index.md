## About Me

Federico Becattini is a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor at the University of Siena, Italy. He obtained his Ph.D. in 2018 from the University of Florence under the supervision of Prof. Alberto Del Bimbo and Prof. Lorenzo Seidenari. His research interests mostly focus on Computer Vision and Deep Learning, working in several fields such as autonomous driving, human behavior understanding and  neuromorphic vision as well as cultural heritage and fashion recommendation. He has a strong interest towards memory-based neural networks, which he has employed in several international publications including top-tier conferences and journals such as CVPR, ECCV, IEEE TPAMI and ACM TOMM. On this subject, he also held tutorials at international conferences such as ICIAP 2022 and ACM MM 2022 and Ph.D. courses at the University of Florence and University of Siena.
Recently, he has also co-organized the workshops “Facial and Body Expressions” at ICPR2020, “Towards a Complete Analysis of People: From Face and Body to Clothes (T-CAP)” at ICIAP2021 and ICPR2022, “Multimedia Computing towards Fashion Recommendation (MCFR)” at ACM MM 2022 and “1st International Workshop and Challenge on People Analysis: From Face, Body, and Fashion to 3D Virtual Avatars (WCPA)” at ECCV 2022. He has co-authored approximately 50 scientific papers in journals and international conferences and he serves as Associate Editor of the International Journal of Multimedia Information Retrieval (IJMIR). He also serves as a reviewer for top-tier conferences and journals in multimedia and computer vision.
